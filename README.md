# React Relay TypeScript Boilerplate

## What is this?

A boilerplate for setting up a React application with Relay, TypeScript and Webpack

## How to run it?

```
cd server/graphql

yarn && yarn create-env && yarn start

cd ../../client

yarn && yarn update-schema && yarn start

```

## TODO

- Code cleanup!!! :-)
- Build script
- docker-compose setup for local development (like in this boilerplate: https://github.com/sorenhoyer/react-relay-rescript-boilerplate/tree/master/client)
- Test setup
- Much more
